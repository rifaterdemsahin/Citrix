Copying and pasting between two different Citrix instances can sometimes be tricky due to clipboard restrictions. Here are some steps you can try to enable this functionality:

1. **Ensure Clipboard Redirection is Enabled**:
   - Make sure that clipboard redirection is enabled in both Citrix sessions. This setting allows you to copy and paste text and images between sessions.
   - You can check this in the Citrix Workspace app settings or through your Citrix administrator.

2. **Use the Same Citrix Workspace Version**:
   - Ensure that both Citrix instances are running the same version of Citrix Workspace. Sometimes, mismatched versions can cause clipboard issues.

3. **Use Right-Click Menu**:
   - If the usual `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` shortcuts don't work, try using the right-click context menu to copy and paste. This method can sometimes bypass clipboard issues.

4. **Update Citrix Workspace**:
   - Make sure you are using the latest version of Citrix Workspace. Updates often include fixes for clipboard and other issues.

5. **Use a Shared Network Drive**:
   - If clipboard sharing is not working, you can use a shared network drive to transfer files or text between the two instances. Save the content to a file in one instance and access it from the other.

6. **Check Citrix Policies**:
   - Sometimes, clipboard functionality can be restricted by Citrix policies set by your IT department. Check with your IT administrator to ensure that clipboard sharing is allowed between sessions.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might need to consult with your IT department for further assistance, as there could be specific configurations or restrictions in place[1](https://community.citrix.com/forums/topic/252554-the-clipboard-function-between-two-vdi-desktops-is-not-working-for-copy-and-paste/)[2](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1412680-copying-and-pasting-from-citrix-remote-session/).
